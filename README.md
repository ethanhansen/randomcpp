# Random C++
This repo will be continually updated with random examples of C++, and generally track my progress as I explore more of the language.

### Disclaimer
This is **not** intended to showcase production code, or anything even remotely close. Most examples may not even work, and this is a way for me to keep track of what I have experimented with, and keep it somewhat organised.
