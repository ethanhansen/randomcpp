# Range Loop

This one is pretty self explanatory. I hate having to do the classic:

```
for (int i = 0; i < something; ++i)
```

Because it looks ugly, and seems outdated, when you consider how extensive the standard library is.

I'll be looking into ranges tomorrow, but for the mean time, I thought I'd try out the Boost irange - pretty neat.
